      Client-server architecture is a computing model where a central server provides resources and services to multiple client devices (computers, phones, etc.) over a network.
      Clients request services from the server, which processes these requests and sends back the requested information or performs the requested action.
      This architecture is fundamental to many internet and network-based applications we use daily, like email, web browsing, online banking, and e-commerce.

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
     Web applications fundamentally operate on a client-server model and are composed of three primary components:
Client-Side (Frontend):
This is the part of the web application that users directly interact with through their web browser. It is built using technologies like HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for interactivity). This component is responsible for presenting the user interface, handling user input, and displaying information.
Server-Side (Backend):
This component resides on a server and handles the core logic of the application. It processes user requests, interacts with the database, performs calculations, and generates responses to be sent back to the client. Common server-side technologies include programming languages like Python, Java, Node.js, PHP, and frameworks built upon them.
Database:
This component stores and manages all the persistent data of the web application. It can be a relational database (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (like MongoDB, Cassandra), chosen based on the application's data storage and retrieval needs. The server-side component interacts with the database to store and retrieve information as required.

    </h2>
    <img src="Types-of-Websites.jpg" alt="types of websites" width="400">
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
    Web content encompasses all the information and digital media presented on a website. This includes text, images, videos, audio, and interactive elements. It can be broadly categorized into passive and interactive content, with various types like blog posts, product pages, case studies, and user-generated content falling under these categories.

 <h2 style="background-color: orange">
      <section id="http-http">HTTP-HTTP Request</section>
    </h2>
    <img src="http.jpg" alt="http-http" width="400">
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
When a user interacts with a web application (e.g., clicks a link, submits a form), the client (browser) constructs an HTTP request based on the desired action and the target resource. This request is then sent over the network to the server hosting the resource. The server processes the request, performs the requested action, and sends back an HTTP response. The response typically includes a status code (indicating success or failure), headers, and potentially a body containing the requested resource or other data.

      <section id="dynamic-web-pages">Dynamic Web Pages</section>
    </h2>
    <img src="dynamic.jpg" alt="dynamic" width="400">
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
Dynamic web pages are web pages whose content can change and adapt based on various factors, such as user interaction, time of day, database information, or other variables. Unlike static web pages, which deliver the same pre-built content to every visitor, dynamic pages offer a personalized and interactive experience.

      <section id="application-servers">Application Servers</section>
    </h2>
    <img src="application_servers.jpg" alt="application servers" width="400">
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">
An application server is a type of server that hosts applications or software, delivering business applications to clients through communication protocols. It sits between the web server (or client) and the database, handling application logic, managing resources, and facilitating interaction between the user interface and the backend database.
